When importing the regions you must import the countries first.

After changing to the inventory directory do the following:

$ . setup_settings
$ cd db/
$ ./import_countries.py regions-country-ISO3166-1-yyyymmdd.csv | tee country.out
$ ./import_regions.py regions-region-ISO3166-1-yyyymmdd.csv | tee region.out

The above should load the country and regions tables and link the two 
together. There may be errors in the .out files relating to unicode conversion.
I did the best I could with the unicode, but not everything is getting converted
correctly.

The data in these tables are from the ISO 3166-1/2 standard.
Updated data can be downloaded from http://www.commondatahub.com/live.

The four Country fields to download are:

ISO 3166-1 COUNTRY NAME,
ISO 3166-1 COUNTRY CHAR 2 CODE,
ISO 3166-1 COUNTRY CHAR 3 CODE,
ISO 3166-1 COUNTRY NUMBER CODE

The four Region fields to download are:

COUNTRY NAME,
ISO 3166-2 SUB-DIVISION/STATE CODE,
ISO 3166-2 SUBDIVISION/STATE NAME,
ISO 3166-2 PRIMARY LEVEL NAME

COUNTRY NAME is for reference only and is not used in the db.
